Opuntia was built to demonstrate that a compact, solar-powered station can reliably collect, backfill, and serve environmental telemetry (temperature, humidity, pressure, soil moisture, UV) to a web dashboard for weeks without human intervention. This project was developed during an IoT course as a practical research prototype. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}\r\n\r\n## Approach & System Overview\r\n\r\nOpuntia emphasizes robustness and autonomy rather than experimental novelty: hardware and software are designed around a strict power budget, reliable timekeeping, and outage recovery.\r\n\r\n- **Hardware:** ESP32-C3 microcontroller, BME280 (temp/humidity/pressure), soil-moisture probe, UV sensor, solar charging circuit with Li-ion battery and BMS.\r\n- **Power strategy:** Duty-cycle the MCU and radio (wake, read, transmit, sleep) to minimize energy use; use the RTC to preserve timestamps across deep sleep.\r\n- **Connectivity & backend:** Wi-Fi to a local router; Node.js/Express API writing to MongoDB for time-series logging and an interactive React + D3 dashboard.\r\n\r\n## Key Technical Decisions\r\n\r\n- Reliable timestamps are essential: the firmware compares RTC time vs. expected wake intervals and marks/backfills missing samples on reconnect to preserve continuity.\r\n- Duty cycling and conservative sensor polling (hourly by default) balanced data fidelity and battery life; the power system was sized to survive multi-day cloudy periods.\r\n- Backend uses a document store (MongoDB) to allow flexible, schema-light time-series logging and easy prototyping of front-end visualizations.\r\n\r\n## Evaluation & Results\r\n\r\n- **Field test (30 days):** The station recorded hourly readings with no downtime; battery remained in safe operating range through cloudy intervals.\r\n- **Sensor accuracy:** Compared to a lab reference, the BME280 readings were within acceptable error bounds (within about 5% for humidity/temperature in the test period).\r\n- **Web access:** Dashboard successfully retrieved hourly updates and supported historical queries and visualization.\r\n\r\n(High-level results summarized from project notes and course write-up.) :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}\r\n\r\n## My Contribution\r\n\r\n- Designed the power system and duty-cycling strategy for reliable off-grid operation.\r\n- Wrote ESP32 firmware (Arduino/C++) to handle sensor reads, RTC-based wake/sleep, and robust transmission with reconnect/backfill logic.\r\n- Built the backend API and the React/D3 dashboard for live and historical visualization.\r\n- Led the field deployment and validation tests.\r\n\r\n## Outcomes & Next Steps\r\n\r\n- Opuntia demonstrates practical autonomy for sensor-driven installations and ecological art. Next steps include adding OTA updates, encrypted telemetry, and optional cellular failover for remote deployments.\r\n",
