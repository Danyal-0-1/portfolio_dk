The goal was to investigate whether TFT's attention and gating mechanisms improve multi-horizon forecasting relative to LSTM baselines and to explore interpretability via attention weights. \r\n\r\n## Approach & System Overview\r\n\r\n- **Data pipeline:** Collected daily S&P prices (Yahoo Finance) and monthly/quarterly macro indicators (FRED). Designed alignment and imputation to handle mixed frequencies and avoid lookahead bias.\r\n- **Models implemented:** TFT (primary) and LSTM (baseline) implemented in PyTorch Lightning; training on GPU with time-series cross-validation splits.\r\n- **Architectural twist:** Experimented with separate embeddings for endogenous (price series) vs. exogenous (macro indicators) inputs to improve feature specialization.\r\n\r\n## Key Technical Points\r\n\r\n- Carefully handled time alignment: for each forecast horizon we limited use of \"known future\" features to only those legitimately available at forecast time.\r\n- Used attention weight visualizations to surface which inputs the model relied on for different horizons (e.g., interest rates for mid-horizon).\r\n- Logged experiments and results with TensorBoard and structured model checkpoints.\r\n\r\n## Results & Takeaways\r\n\r\n- TFT provided modest improvements (~5% RMSE improvement over tuned LSTM baselines) in the tested windows; TFT training incurred higher compute/time costs but offered improved interpretability via attention heatmaps.\r\n- Ablation showed that removing macroeconomic exogenous features increased error noticeably (~~10% in some splits), suggesting their value for multi-horizon forecasting.\r\n- These results are course-level exploratory findings and illustrate competence with modern temporal architectures and disciplined experimental practice in constrained timelines. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}\r\n\r\n## My Contribution\r\n\r\n- Led the data engineering: multi-source ingestion, alignment, and preprocessing.\r\n- Implemented the TFT and LSTM training loops, evaluation metrics, and ablation experiments.\r\n- Produced attention visualizations and draft report/presentation for the course.\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\n\r\n- Extend the setup to include higher-frequency real-time indicators, perform more robust cross-validation, and explore physically informed priors for improved generalization in volatile regimes.\r\n",
