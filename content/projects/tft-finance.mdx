## Project Context

Developed as the final project for a graduate Deep Learning course, this effort applied Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT) to S&P 500 forecasting using a mixed-frequency pipeline that combined daily price data with lower-frequency macroeconomic indicators. The goal was to investigate whether TFT's attention and gating mechanisms improve multi-horizon forecasting relative to LSTM baselines and to explore interpretability via attention weights. 

## Approach & System Overview

- **Data pipeline:** Collected daily S&P prices (Yahoo Finance) and monthly/quarterly macro indicators (FRED). Designed alignment and imputation to handle mixed frequencies and avoid lookahead bias.
- **Models implemented:** TFT (primary) and LSTM (baseline) implemented in PyTorch Lightning; training on GPU with time-series cross-validation splits.
- **Architectural twist:** Experimented with separate embeddings for endogenous (price series) vs. exogenous (macro indicators) inputs to improve feature specialization.

## Key Technical Points

- Carefully handled time alignment: for each forecast horizon we limited use of "known future" features to only those legitimately available at forecast time.
- Used attention weight visualizations to surface which inputs the model relied on for different horizons (e.g., interest rates for mid-horizon).
- Logged experiments and results with TensorBoard and structured model checkpoints.

## Results & Takeaways

- TFT provided modest improvements (~5% RMSE improvement over tuned LSTM baselines) in the tested windows; TFT training incurred higher compute/time costs but offered improved interpretability via attention heatmaps.
- Ablation showed that removing macroeconomic exogenous features increased error noticeably (~~10% in some splits), suggesting their value for multi-horizon forecasting.
- These results are course-level exploratory findings and illustrate competence with modern temporal architectures and disciplined experimental practice in constrained timelines. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

## My Contribution

- Led the data engineering: multi-source ingestion, alignment, and preprocessing.
- Implemented the TFT and LSTM training loops, evaluation metrics, and ablation experiments.
- Produced attention visualizations and draft report/presentation for the course.

## Next Steps

- Extend the setup to include higher-frequency real-time indicators, perform more robust cross-validation, and explore physically informed priors for improved generalization in volatile regimes.
