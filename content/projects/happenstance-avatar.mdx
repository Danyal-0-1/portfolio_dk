## Overview

An in-progress pipeline that turns a single human photograph into a rigged, animation-ready avatar for virtual worlds.

## Pipeline

- Built a pipeline that converts a single human photograph into a high-resolution 3D character.
- Used Facebook Research PiFUHD (pixel-aligned implicit function) for image-based human digitization.
- Rigged the extracted meshes using Mixamo to generate full armatures and animation readiness.
- Produced several animations; characters import cleanly into game engines and virtual environments.
- Goal: a faster, repeatable end-to-end workflow where users can input an image and receive a rigged, animation-ready avatar.

## Media (coming soon)

Images and short clips will be added once the pipeline outputs are finalized.
