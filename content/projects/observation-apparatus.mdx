## Overview

An in-progress study combining satellite imagery and street-level imagery to examine how observational systems construct surveillance.

## Notes

- Combined satellite imagery and street-level imagery (Google Street View) to explore how observational apparatuses operate as surveillance systems.
- Focus: how scale, vantage point, and infrastructure shape what becomes legible and governable.
- This will be presented as an exhibition piece; images will be added later.

## Media (coming soon)

Exhibition images and documentation will be added after the first presentation.
