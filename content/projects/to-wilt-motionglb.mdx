## Overview

A focused installation study that pairs a multi-camera time-lapse dataset with a MotionGLB pipeline to explore temporal modeling of organic decay.

## Pipeline

- Captured a week-long synchronized time-lapse of a rose wilting using 4 Sony cameras.
- Produced a dataset (22k+ images) for a temporal model of wilting dynamics.
- Automated background removal in Photoshop via scripting, isolating the rose across frames.
- Ran the dataset through Microsoft's Trillions model to generate web-based MotionGLB outputs.
